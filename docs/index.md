## Overview
This page allows you to interactively analyze how mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) affect escape from monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal sera.
It does this by integrating multiple experimental studies by the [Bloom lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/bloom/en.html) that use [deep mutational scanning to completely map how all mutations to the RBD affect antibody or sera binding](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820306247).

Specifically, the data shown here are from experiments that [quantify the effects on antibody / sera binding of all RBD mutations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820306247) that are tolerated for protein folding and ACE2-binding
(For how mutations affect RBD folding and ACE2-binding, see this [interactive visualization](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/) of the experimental measurements described [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420310035).)
There are two site-level escape metrics: the sum of the effects of all mutations at a site, and the mean effect of all tolerated mutations at a site (use the selection box at the bottom of the plots to choose the escape metric).
In addition, there is an option (selected by default) to "normalize" the escape metric across antibodies and sera to account for variation across experiments (done as described in second sentence of the *Data Visualization* methods subsection of [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312821000822)).

The multidimensional scaling plot at the upper left arranges antibodies and sera in the "space of escape" such that ones with similar escape mutations are positioned close to each other (see [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820306247) for methodological details).
Hover over a point to see what antibody / serum it corresponds to, and click to select it in other plots too.
Use shift-click to make multiple selections, and double-click to clear them.
Multidimensional scaling involves a random seed; use the selection box at the bottom of the plot to choose different seeds for slightly different layouts.
You can choose which types of antibodies or sera to display via the small box to the right of the multidimensional scaling plot.
The antibodies are grouped into classes based on the [Barnes et al classification scheme](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2852-1), and sera are grouped based on whether they are convalescent or vaccine-elicited.

The upper of the two line plots shows thin lines giving the escape metric at each site for all antibodies / sera of the types that are currently chosen for display.
Click on a line to bold it and highlight that antibody / serum in the other plots.
You can use the zoom bar to get a closer look at specific sites of interest.

The lower of the two line plots shows the **mean** escape at each site for all antibodies / sera you have selected by clicking, or over all antibodies / sera of the type(s) that are displayed in the multidimensional scaling plot (choose which of these it shows via the selection box immediately below this line plot).
These averages are useful to get a general sense of sites that have effects over entire sets of antibodies or sera.

In the upper-right of the plot, you can select antibodies / sera by name by clicking on the boxes by their names (use the zoom bar to find names that are cut off below the plot).
You can also shift-click the hyperlinks next to the names to open the citation that reports the experimental data, or get a detailed [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/) of the data projected onto a [crystal structure of the RBD bound to ACE2](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J).

## Escape calculator
The monoclonal antibody data described here is used to implement an [escape calculator](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2_RBD_Ab_escape_maps/escape-calc/) that can estimate the antigenic effects of mutating arbitrary combinations of RBD sites.

## Raw data and code
The experimental data plotted here are available in [this CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbloomlab/SARS2_RBD_Ab_escape_maps/main/processed_data/escape_data.csv).

The computer code that generates the interactive plot and this rest of this website from that raw data is at [https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2_RBD_Ab_escape_maps](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2_RBD_Ab_escape_maps).
