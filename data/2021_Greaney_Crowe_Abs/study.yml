study_title: Complete mapping of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain that escape antibody recognition

study_first_author: Greaney

study_year: 2021

study_journal: Cell Host Microbe

study_url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820306247

lab: Bloom_JD

spike: Wuhan-Hu-1

notes: "Data comparable to those in Table S1 of the paper but re-generated using the new and more stringent expression and ACE2 binding cutoffs described in Starr et al, Science, abf9302 (2021) that the Bloom lab has started to use for all their yeast-display RBD deep mutational scanning."
